# Problem Statement
Given certain weather and market conditions, the cost of energy increases and decreases. In a home, there are certain periods in a day when operating certain energy-consuming appliances are preferable. Such as running the dishwasher, etc. When information regarding the surrounding weather is given, how can we determine the best time to operate and run these appliances, so we consume the least amount of energy? With any machine learning techniques could we extract some more meaningful information about the residents and their behavior from this dataset? Could we use that extracted data to discover new means to save energy?

# Selected Dataset/Environment
The selected Dataset is: Smart Home Dataset with weather Information [1]. This IOT dataset contains the readings with a time span of 1 minute of house appliances in kW from a smart meter and weather conditions.

# Goals and Objective
The goal of the project is to optimize the energy consumption of a house using a Supervised Machine Learning model. The objective is to use the Classification Machine Learning Model to classify and cluster the optimal times to use household appliances and reduce the net energy consumption of the household.

# Solution
The proposed solution is mentioned in the steps below:

1. Collect the raw data containing the household appliance energy consumption data in one-minute intervals.
1. Train the Classification machine learning model using the raw data.
1. Test the model for performance metrics and evaluate if the performance is acceptable.
1. Use the model on the raw data to find the optimal times on a given day to increase the energy efficiency of the house.
1. Report the findings and results.
